# AlgorithmVisualizer

Algorithm Visualizer helps you to visualise all types of Sorting Algorithms.
Here i have implemented 5 types of Sorting Algorithms i.e
1) Selection Sort
2) Bubble Sort
3) Insertion Sort
4) Merge Sort
5) Quick Sort

I was not able to visualize and implemented the Heap Sort, so if you have a better understanding of Heap Sort then you can contribute here.
In future i will be adding Graph Algorithms.
